## Key Features

1. **User Input Validation**:
   - Validates email and password fields for proper format and non-empty values.
   - Highlights invalid fields with visual indicators.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Displays error messages for:
     - Empty fields.
     - Incorrect login credentials.
     - Invalid email format.

3. **Sign-In Logic**:
   - Sends user credentials to the backend for authentication.

## Component Workflow

1. **User Inputs Credentials**:
   - Users fill in the email and password fields.

2. **Validation**:
   - On form submission, the component validates the input:
     - Checks for empty fields.
     - Ensures the email is in the correct format.
     - Verifies the password length.

3. **API Request**:
   - Sends the email and password to the backend API for authentication.
   - If the credentials are correct, the user is signed in and redirected.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the API returns an error (e.g., incorrect password), displays an error message.
